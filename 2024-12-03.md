Today is International Day of People with Disabilities #IDPwD #AwarenessDay
Over the next year, we'll be looking at various disabilities and discussing disability in society, representation in media and more. We'll look at both the social model of disability and the medical model of disability.
I have an analytical and scientific mind so I might talk a lot about the medical side of disability but I intend to talk about ALL things related to disability.
You're more than welcome to give recommendations about what topics I should discuss and if I don't have an answer for you today, I will try and cover it in a future session.

## Disclaimer
I am not a medical professional. Where possible, I will try to ask both professionals and people with the condition prior to making a presentation about a disability. Please do not use my content to diagnose yourself or others.
