Hello there and happy International Day of People with Disabilities.
It's a really long name and I'm talking about that in a second.
I have got a lot that I want to say about various topics.
Yeah, this is exciting.
So, yeah, I had this idea.
Really, like, I didn't get my audio sorted.
That was not a very good feedback, but we'll ignore that.
So, I had this idea at, like, four in the morning.
Well, no, I didn't.
I did a lot of preparation at four in the morning.
It's now 1pm.
I woke up an hour ago and the lighting here is not really flattering.
But I had this idea yesterday, so it's a bit of short notice.
I was planning to start this in the new year for, like, the first or second week of 2025.
And then I thought, hmm, you know what, I think I should do one session today and see how it goes.
Um, now, I'm going to put my phone up here and give myself a better camera one sec.
I will try not to fall.
Can you get me?
Okay, considering I did that without actually being able to see the camera, that's not bad.
Is that working?
Hello?
Okay, weird angle.
It's the best I can do right now.
So, I thought what I want to do is do weekly streams, maybe weekly, maybe every other week.
And I want to just talk about disability.
Disability is a topic that really interests me.
I love talking about disability.
And so, I am disabled, by the way.
Power chair.
I like this power chair.
So, I've been a full-time wheelchair user since basically I was born.
I was born with a red condition.
And so, yeah, I've always used a wheelchair.
And so, that gives me one, like, perspective of life.
I have a lot of friends who are disabled and are either ambulatory wheelchair users,
which I am not.
Or they are, um, what sort of looking for, they have acquired disabilities.
So, I think that both of those things give different life experiences.
I mean, of course, when we talk about disability, it is a lot more than just wheelchairs.
It is, um, with its blindness, its autism, it's like cerebral palsy.
It's, uh, I don't know.
Like, when I talk about disability, I don't just mean physical disability.
It might also be neurological, neurodiversity.
Um, my brain keeps disappearing.
Intellectual or mental health.
Um, it could be, like, so many different types of disabilities.
And I want to try and look at as many different disabilities as possible.
Um, the idea is, I'm not a trained professional.
I'm not a medical professional.
I'm not a doctor or anything like that.
But, I'm just going to come on here and talk about disability and give my own views.
And I do like to do a lot of research into, um, different disabilities.
And so, I think I have more knowledge than an average person does.
Um, and before each disability session, I will talk to various people who I know have a condition.
I'll do my research, basically.
I'm just going to pull words out my backside.
Um, so, yeah, that's, that's my plan.
Uh, did I forget to do a category?
Yes, I did.
On Twitch.
So, we are streaming on Twitch and we are on YouTube.
I would say we'd also be on Instagram, but we're not.
I don't think.
Um, and, yeah, we've got a few different channels to say.
My name is Joel.
I don't know if I said that yet.
I am parked.
Why is the subtitles not working?
We're supposed to have subtitles, but they're not working.
I know.
Because I forgot to press that button.
Okay.
Great.
So, I was meant to be, uh,
and all testing, testing subtitles.
There we go.
Kind of, no.
Um, what was I going to say?
Yeah, my name's Joel and I am the owner of the disability network.
The subtitles are appalling right now.
Hello.
No, we've just decided that subtitles are...
We have just decided that subtitles are not going to work.
Okay.
So, subtitles often have issues picking up my voice.
Um, you can see that being demonstrated perfectly here.
Okay, it gets like every couple words.
Um, that is not reliable enough to have on stream.
This works yesterday.
When I tested it, well, I said yesterday.
This works at 4am.
It works reasonably well considering the fact that when I'm really tired,
I don't enunciate.
I'm not really tired.
I'm not really sorry.
I'm really tired.
Okay, we're going to turn off subtitles because that is not working at all.
Um, however, we'll go back to this.
Um, so I want to look at lots of different disabilities.
My name is...
I'll try to finish in a sentence now.
My name is Joel.
I am the owner and founder of the disability network,
which is a Discord server for disabled people.
Able-bodied people are more than welcome to join as well.
We are aimed at disabled people,
no matter what kind of disability you have.
And it...
Okay, story time.
Um, I started...
So I started a podcast with a friend of mine called Julia.
She's not here today.
She's working.
I didn't think I even told her that I was planning to do this today.
She might just randomly find it on the, um, ramped up social media.
I'm like, what is this?
Um...
But I met her at college and, uh, we were both in student council.
And we both had the same role, basically,
which was advocating for disabled people trying to make college more accessible
to people.
We did a few different projects, um, which I enjoyed, definitely.
But that started, like,
it got me really into doing activism and advocacy.
Um, and also,
it kind of made me go, huh?
I know a lot about disability.
I like talking about disability.
I would like to, uh...
You know, do this kind of...
Yeah, talk about disability.
When me and Julia first met, we had a...
I think it was only a 20-minute run.
Julia will tell you it was an hour. It wasn't.
Because it was in my lunch break...
No, not lunch break, it was between a break in lessons.
I had gone down to the canteen.
And I couldn't be there for longer than 10 minutes.
And I went to grab a snack.
And went back up to class.
And saw another friend.
I was like, I just spent the entire of that break
talking to a disabled person.
And I was so happy.
Because I think, particularly at the time,
I didn't know many disabled people.
And I think that when disabled people get to talk together
and just be like...
It reminds me that you're not alone.
And I think sometimes disability can feel really...
Isolating.
Oh, Julia is listening.
Hello, Julia.
Hello.
Lovely to see you.
Yeah, welcome.
If you would like to join the stream,
let me know and we can bring you one.
Um...
But...
I've lost my train of thought now.
Yeah, so we started a podcast.
We were like, we're just ranting for ages.
Um...
Let's make this a regular thing.
Let other people be able to hear our rambles.
And so...
That's what we did.
We did Series 2 last year.
We're getting started to...
We're getting ready to release Series 3.
I'm the one doing the editing.
It's taken me ridiculously long.
But hopefully that will also be coming in a new year.
Um, this series, by the way,
we are talking to disabled...
No, we're talking to particularly autistic
and autistic people and people with ADHD.
Um, about special interests and type of expectations.
And they basically have three ways to just
improduce to us.
Which is really fun. I love hearing.
Um...
Ooh, Julia wants to join.
I don't know how...
How to do that.
Because I didn't prepare this in advance.
Um...
What's the easiest way?
Without me doctoring myself.
That is a critical question.
Also, how do I do it without him?
Uh, Julia, if you're there,
join the...
Discord server.
Um...
And...
I was trying to get something to work.
Uh, yeah, I didn't prepare at all.
In advance.
My internet might also crash.
So this might not work.
We're gonna see.
Um...
Anything.
I'm worried that someone will just go out.
Okay.
While I'm trying to get that working,
I'm gonna keep talking.
Um...
We also...
Where does that go?
I know, but I've just gone silent
while I'm trying to get this to work.
Right.
Discord.
You won't be able to hear that.
Let's figure out how to...
Okay.
We're gonna test this as we go.
Um...
That's what I was saying.
Um...
What was I saying?
Uh...
I've really lost track now.
I got distracted.
Well, not distracted.
A nice distraction.
But not one that I intended to have.
Um...
Oh, yeah.
And people just info-dump about their special interests
or have fixations.
If you would like to be a guest,
put it in the comments down below,
and I will give you instructions about how to do that.
Um...
And how you can get involved.
Um...
So that's how...
Out of that grew the Disability Network Discord server.
And this is something that I'm really proud of.
This is something that I really believe in.
Uh...
I'm neglecting other aspects of my life.
For Disability Network.
Shouldn't be doing that.
But I am.
Um...
I think Julie is joining.
Woo.
Yeah.
Um...
I don't know where she is though.
I don't know.
I don't have her yet.
Um...
I'm trying to get all of this ready before she joins.
Hey!
We did it.
Let's see.
Hello.
Am I doing this right?
I have no idea what I'm doing.
You are currently live.
We got it working.
I wasn't sure if that was going to work or not.
What?
I don't know.
I don't know what's going to work or not.
Okay.
Um...
Yeah.
Again.
This is completely unplanned.
Uh...
Do you want to turn your camera on?
I'll see if I can turn mine on as well.
I am...
I'm currently in my kitchen.
Oh.
Okay.
This was not that.
No.
That was not.
Uh...
Turn on camera.
I don't know how attractive
me being in my kitchen doing my laundry.
What do you know?
That's fine.
We're here.
Why not?
Hello.
How are you?
I'm very well.
Hi.
Hey, we got it to work.
I found out from YouTube
because I'm the subscribed
and subscribed to the Brampton Podcast YouTube channel.
Yes, I'm that person.
And, um...
And I was like,
you, they are live.
And I'm like,
hello, live?
Yeah.
And I went to the discord server.
Like,
today it will be live.
And I'm like,
who's we?
Definitely not me.
That's for sure.
Well, you are now.
Um...
Can I carry on this story?
Uh...
As always,
I have gotten just back today.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Um...
Okay, that's the button I'm looking for.
Yeah.
Let's use the subtitles
of discord
and see...
Hello.
Okay.
I'm not sure if it's to go right.
We will see.
Um...
That's my main due captions
for the time being.
Um...
Uh...
I'm trying to make this look...
Okay.
Captions still aren't working there.
Anyway.
It's International Day of People with Disabilities.
Um...
That's a long name.
I hate it.
I personally would call it
International Day of Disabled People.
So it ends it just a bit.
Um...
Okay.
Having the subtitles
gets my name so...
get my words so wrong.
It's going to drive me crazy.
Um...
But essentially my plan for
the series is
we're going to
look at different disabilities.
I have a list.
We get...
I don't know how many people have heard of Obsidian.
Um...
It looks like this.
Uh...
Come up quickly.
And you get like a graph
and you can connect
all of these pages together.
And some of them look really cool.
But I'm going to build a
database with the wrong words.
But I'm going to build like a big
comprehensive sort of
different disabilities
and just talk about it and see how
each disability can kind of link together
the similarities
and differences between them
and all that kind of thing.
Um...
And...
Yeah.
This is something that I'm really excited to do.
Um...
I...
How do I phrase this?
So...
My experience in talking about disability
I am disabled, which
kind of means I have to talk about disability
to someone at some point in my life.
Um...
Whether it's like
me being like,
hey, I would like to be able to use your toilet.
Um...
That happens a lot.
Where you're just like,
um, your accessible toilet
is not accessible.
That's basically part of being disabled.
It's reviewing...
Me?
Disabled toilets.
Yeah.
It's the same amount of conversation I've had
with my friends who are not
even disabled, they're able-bodied,
you know,
people.
And they're like,
really, I feel every disabled person is
accessible.
Not really.
So it's pretty good to you.
Yeah.
Um...
Toilets are not really accessible by and large.
Um...
I have seen
a few,
like, really good toilets.
That's such a weird sentence.
Oh, am I?
There's one in my universe
that I might always go into.
I had to refuse to go into any of the toilets
because I know that's great.
Yeah.
I don't know if it's my...
What is up with this spot?
Because I did not say
you that many times.
What is it?
It's like, I refuse to go into any of the toilets.
No.
Okay, I'm just going to get it to leave the channel
because it's going to annoy me.
Um...
Yeah.
So...
Let's talk about the two different,
or the mean to different models
of disability.
Um...
I think there's three.
I can't remember the third one up the top of my head.
But we're going to talk about them anyway.
Um...
Let me see if I can
get OBS on my phone.
I'm going to be hopefully...
Oops.
No, don't do that.
It won't be easier.
Fine.
So...
What's green are we on?
Are we on the right screen?
Yeah, we are.
So let's talk about the social model
of disability first.
Um...
No.
We won't.
Let's talk about the medical
model of disability.
What's that?
What's that?
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what it is.
I have no idea what you just said.
I just said I didn't know there was such a thing
as a model of disability.
I thought you needed it.
Okay.
Now I get to educate.
No, I didn't.
This is completely new information to me.
Wow.
Okay.
Medical model
of
disability.
The number of times I've written this...
I don't know if you're...
Are you screen sharing right now?
Because on the...
You're on Discord.
Because I know that is one great way
to crash everything.
Okay, great.
So I'm going to just act
like I know what you're saying
and what you're showing people
because I don't see anything.
That's okay.
I'll watch later.
I'll watch the back page.
Okay.
Yeah.
So the medical model is the...
Or particularly was the main
way of looking at disability.
I can't type and talk at the same time.
Or
thinking about disability.
It's the first thing you think of
when you see disability.
Yeah.
Kind of.
Also,
society's attitudes
are what we're really thinking about.
Oh, yeah.
If we go back before I was born
over 30 years ago.
I'm not 30 years old, by the way.
But
if we go back...
Just so it's clear.
If we go back in time and we talk
about...
I mean, look at how disabled people were treated.
There's like some really distressing images
of young autistic children
being put in fake jackets
because people didn't know how to deal with them.
People didn't want to interact with them.
People were institutionalised
all the time
for no reason.
Just because...
Yeah.
People were seen as very undesirable.
And in some countries
it's still like that, unfortunately.
So
Julia, we've spoken in the past
about how
in Poland, where you're from,
you just wouldn't have a very good life.
Now
personally, I would have been treated
basically as a child
not above the age of five, for example.
So basically you would get an education
and think until
like our version of college
but it wouldn't be the level...
Everyone's in the same class
working on the same level until
the legal requirement
of education.
And that is it.
There's very little chance
of going into university.
There's very little chance of you
getting employable skills.
There's very little chance of you
actually going to get employed
by a company, basically,
or anywhere.
And just all in all,
my parents were kind of told
or suggested
to give me a way to start over.
Which my parents were absolutely not.
We are not doing that.
And basically
my family was
very much strong
strongly opinionated on that.
We want her, we want to keep her
in the family. We want to help raise her.
And yeah, moved here
and to be fair, I don't regret
everyone coming here
or like our parents coming here.
I quite like where I live.
Yeah.
I might still as like
the kind of attitude that people have.
Even in America, which surprises me.
So there was a
a new show that came out
fairly recently, like less than a month ago,
I think,
called Out of My Mind.
And it's about
Oh, I know it!
Yeah.
It's about a girl with cerebral palsy
who is
just
treated like a child.
She's a teenager and
she's just,
because she's non-verbal
she's just, as you say,
dumped in a class with
a bunch of other different people
who are all different ages
and different levels of comprehension.
And she's a bright girl
and she's just duck and miss
basically repeating the same year
for years.
Which
yeah, it's so
yeah, so devastating
to just be
as
incapable of anything
because you can't talk.
Anyway, I got off topic.
I want to get into that
in a lot more detail another time.
But that is a really good movie,
not sponsored,
but I highly recommend that.
The medical model is
where we look to fix
a person
rather than society.
And the argument for that is
it's easier to fix one person
than society.
To an extent, yes.
But no.
Because obviously,
if we look at the World Health
Organization
statistics,
20 to 25%
of the world are disabled.
Now, trying to fix
all of those people
is not
possible.
And so
yeah,
what are you doing for
me?
I thought, sorry, my phone's
voice assistant just activated itself.
Yeah,
so rather than trying
to fix every single person across
the world, we can change
people's attitudes
because that's the main issue
that needs pixeling in society.
It's the way that people
perceive disabled people.
It's the way
that people treat others.
Which is actually easier to change
than you might think.
That's, I think, the biggest hurdle.
I mean, I could talk about
step-free access for wheelchairs
and using Braille on signage
and all that kind
of thing. But a lot of that
is
like you need to change
people's minds at first.
You need to educate people
and help people to
understand
what it's
like to be disabled.
And if you
help people to empathize,
then they are more likely
to try to change
and
you just need one person
to change
and to be a better person
and that has a ripple on effect.
If you can get the right
people to change
for the better,
they will change other people as well.
And
when you have a society
of better people.
So that's
It does take time.
Sorry?
It does take time.
It takes a lot of time.
And also, what I think is also important
is
it's important to have allies.
So us as disabled people,
we can advocate for ourselves
all we would like.
And sometimes we don't
get listened to, if that makes sense.
And sometimes having those allies
who do listen,
who do want there to be changed
are usually the ones
who would help
amplify it
and make it more
noticeable to the masses,
which is frustrating
because it's quite the right people,
but it's so worth it again.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that is kind of
I forgot that.
You're not on screen.
I don't know how people can see.
Yeah, so that is kind of
that.
Maybe not.
I'm using right now.
So if they are looking at me,
he's not working right now.
There.
This is your lunch break.
I forgot that.
I will keep doing these at this time.
This just seems like a good time
that works at the moment.
I won't probably be available
every single time,
but I saw you alive
at the lunch break as well.
Yeah, I wasn't expecting you to join.
It's very nice for you to join.
I do find it easy to
talk off,
talk back to someone
and have a live interaction.
I noticed that when you were struggling,
I was like,
let me just hop on real quick,
help him regulate himself a little bit.
Thank you.
I greatly appreciate it.
Um...
Yeah.
Are we not on YouTube?
Why are we on YouTube?
Oh yeah, my internet just closed.
I just forgot.
Um...
When was I?
Yeah, so...
Social model is where we try to change society
and make society
more accessible to different people.
So that might be nine in nine language,
that might be
being more accepting of
people showing
their quote-quote weirdness.
So...
That might be another example.
It's basically trying to make society
more empathetic. That's how I would
summarize it.
If you phrase it like that, it's a lot less intimidating
because empathy is a good thing.
Obviously, step-free access
is a good thing,
but people don't see it like that for some reason.
Is it really something as simple as
an extra restaurant?
How many times have we went to a restaurant?
It says it's step-free
and it's applicable with a wheelchair,
with a toilet, and it isn't.
No, no.
It just proves a point of how it's important.
Yeah, absolutely.
Um...
Yeah, so the medical model
is more about trying to fix a person
and
the social model is about trying to fix
the
society around the person.
Um...
But if you have the intention of trying to
get the disabled person
to be more
a part of a community of society,
um...
But there's just complete
different ways of doing it.
The medical model, the reason why
most people don't like medical model anymore
is because
disabled people, I should say,
is because
it's
inferring that
the disabled person is
defective.
Um...
Which is so sad.
I don't consider myself defective.
Um...
Like, it looks like I have dwarfism.
I don't actually.
But that's a...
I say that I have dwarfism sometimes
when people understand my body
without having to describe it.
Um, it's not dwarfism, but
people would mistake it for dwarfism.
Um...
Wait, sorry. What do you mean by
like, you, especially when you've got dwarfism?
Huh?
Like the characteristics and you have
the characteristics of dwarfism?
Oh, yeah. So the height of it, yeah.
Um...
So I'm three feet tall.
Um...
That kind of...
To describe my body type,
I should say.
Um...
But I don't...
I'm really confused. I'm like, I would have never thought...
Like, okay, another table person
I again would have not guessed
you as someone has dwarfism.
Really?
That's just personal.
You know, I wouldn't have guessed that.
That's all.
I'm not diagnosed for the record.
Um...
I've been paired diagnosed by many people.
No, I know that.
Um...
Again, if I was a paired diagnosed,
I would not put you as dwarfism at all.
Oh, dwarfism.
It would have been completely...
Did you say dwarfism?
Yeah, I wouldn't have guessed that.
I wouldn't have even placed it as an option.
That makes sense.
Oh, I see.
Personally, I wouldn't.
I've always had autism.
And so I was like, I've been paired diagnosed.
I was like, you don't think I do?
Um...
I mean, I know you do,
because you are not officially diagnosed,
but I've just got my knowledge at this point.
Yeah.
Um...
The train of thought is gone.
I might always have ADHD.
I have no idea what it is.
Maybe you are.
I have a feeling I am.
People keep saying that I am.
I don't know if I agree.
But, um...
I get distracted quite easily.
I regularly lose my train of thought.
So if you would like to follow the series,
just be prepared for that.
Um...
It's also a lot of editing
that comes into play.
So if Joel does lose his train of thought,
it's mostly editing now.
Yes, definitely.
Uh, you can't do that with a live stream.
Mm-hmm.
It's the joy of live streaming.
Your mistakes are public.
Yes. Very scary.
You know what?
When I did my first ever live stream,
it wasn't about disability, it was for gaming.
And...
I adopted myself
by accident in the first...
In the first stream.
What do you mean? What did you do?
I think
my camera fell.
And it went...
It showed my, like, a letter on the table
with my address on it.
Oh, no!
Joel!
Thankfully, because it was my first stream,
there was no one watching.
But I had to delete it.
It would be worse if you were 100,000.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Thankfully, we don't have that issue
at the moment.
I think we don't have that many people
doing this yet.
No.
That's okay. I don't mind at the moment.
This will be recorded when we can, like,
I'll try a bit.
Um...
Anyway,
I'm trying to make notes. I'm failing.
I don't know how people do that.
Like, with a streamer I've watched,
who I think is called, like,
healthy gamer or something,
healthy...
like that.
And...
he talks about, like, mental health.
And while he's talking,
he's writing stuff down.
And I was going to be like, I'm going to do that.
And I'm not doing it anymore.
Absolutely.
What I do when I've got a few sensations
is I write notes for myself
and for the point notes,
as I'm talking, just like,
yeah.
Like, because I can't do, like,
free styling,
I can't do it.
We've established that already.
I can't do it.
What's this?
I'm going to merge...
with this stuff.
Uh, so...
What are we talking about?
We're talking about the models of disability.
What are we talking about?
Modules.
Uh, so this model tries to think...
a picture of a person.
Uh, it is...
or it was...
very popular.
Very popular.
Uh,
like...
I wouldn't say 40 plus years ago.
Uh, disabled people...
who couldn't...
be cured...
were often hidden away.
They were often...
hidden from society.
Uh,
and...
disabled people were often pressured.
Get treatment, weren't they?
Yeah, into getting a cure.
Into...
cured, or getting treatment.
Uh, so, Julie,
because you can't see this,
I have a...
basically a Word document.
Um, which I'm writing into.
Or trying to...
I'm feeling in the process.
Um...
Whereas the social model...
uh...
tries to...
fix society...
slash...
uh...
the mindset...
of...
able-bodied people.
And I say able-bodied people,
but that doesn't necessarily mean
that disabled people can't also have
this mindset where
they have to be cured.
In fact, I was talking about this with
a friend of mine yesterday.
Um, so...
I need to think about what I say before I say it.
So that I say it in a sensitive way.
Okay.
Can I ask something?
Is it about hidden disability?
Uh, kind of, but not really.
Yeah.
Just so that way I know the conflict
we're seeing about now is that way
I can step in if needed.
Um, so...
it's more people who
have acquired better disability.
So...
I...
as I said,
I was born with my disability.
And so it's always been a part of me.
Um...
where I think some people who have
acquired their disability
have kind of got it...
like...
I don't know, is it some kind of denial?
It's like grief
where they're like,
I want to be able to walk again.
Um, and that's like...
but it's so...
like, I cannot live my life
unless I am able to walk.
Um...
which...
okay, as a wheelchair user myself
and one who's been always disabled
kind of hurts a little bit.
Um...
it's like, it's been disabled that bad.
Um...
like, I completely understand that
people...
disability is hard.
That's why it's a disability.
It does disable you.
Um...
But for it to be...
seen as
being able-bodied, being seen as
a sort of happiness,
like you have to be
able-bodied to be happy
or...
trying to make sure that
disability is on the temporary
is...
I don't think it's healthy.
I'll put it that way.
Um...
like, yeah, if you have a spinal injury
and you want to be able to walk,
then okay.
But...
where it becomes an obsession
or a...
focus, like...
where?
Yeah. It's not you
who should be looking to be fixed.
I don't think.
Um...
And I know that's, like, a really
divisive...
a really divisive topic.
Um...
Oh, I thought you were going to say something.
Um...
Yeah, I don't know...
I'm not
the best person to be
talking about this subject.
Like, properly do this
subject justice
when I have other people here
who are physically...
who have had an
acquired disability
and therefore can
not argue with me, but debate with me.
Um, because I don't want to be...
like...
like that. I have, um...
I want someone to bounce back
off of because
I might not be right.
I might not be right about everything I say.
And...
because I have one type of disability
and I was born with it, I have one perspective.
It's like what I was saying at the start.
I have one perspective.
Um...
But that doesn't mean it's necessarily right.
Um, and so I wouldn't have conversations
like that, uh, hopefully.
Um...
I need to get from one of the public
if you know someone
who, since you've mentioned it,
maybe ask them if they're comfortable
having a conversation with us.
Yeah. That would be a very good idea.
Um, I wonder if she's listening.
I'm not actually talking to anyone about
what I'm doing, so
I doubt she's listening at the moment.
I mean, uh,
the Discord knows, so
if anyone has seen it,
they should be joining
as watching.
Yeah. We do have...
I did invite our Discord server.
Um...
Yeah, I don't think
that she's online at the moment.
But yeah, I'd love to talk to her about it
because it was a really interesting conversation.
Um...
Yeah. So Resolution Model
tries to pick the society
slash the mindset of able-bodied people.
Um...
It often involves...
uh...
lots
of
advocacy
and
activism.
That's not how you spell activism.
There we go. Um...
There is another model,
but I forget what it's called.
Models of
disability.
And
this is also
me learning because I had no idea
about this. I just thought
there's like two ways of seeing it.
Either have a disability, not two ways.
There's multiple ways of seeing it. Where
you've been born with it, you're getting
it over time, or you have
a disability. And that is it.
Or you're not getting it.
It's all fun.
Ah, I never knew that one.
At all.
Uh...
Wait, who created the model?
What's that saying?
Do you know who created
the model?
I do not.
Uh...
I think it's more society
views rather than one person
creating a model.
It's like...
Um...
Yeah, it's society's
views. So,
the third model, which
I don't think is so much...
It's seen much less than
the Western world. Um...
We still see it, to some extent.
What's called the moral model.
And, uh, basically
it's seen as disability
is
the result of
basically sin.
Uh...
Or, like, doing something
that it's, like, hard.
Yeah.
And, let me tell you
that one recently, I did.
Yeah.
Surprisingly, I've not had many instances of that.
I have had a number of
people trying to heal me
through prayer, which I'm not a fan of.
Particularly as a Christian myself.
Um...
I used to pray
every night that God would tell me
when I was, like, eight
and he didn't.
Uh...
And it took me a while.
But for me personally, I believe that
for whatever reason, God wants me to be disabled.
I don't know why.
Um...
But the fact that
many...
My mum has a lot of time.
When that would come...
Uh... Should I be content?
Um...
The idea that
God wants me to be healthy.
I understand
to an extent, but
not really.
Because he doesn't.
I don't know why.
I don't know why he chose me to be disabled.
But I believe that he has.
Um...
Do you want to talk a bit about
about the models of disability?
I'll be back in one second.
Can you sit there?
I'm still here.
Okay.
I need to leave very quickly.
I'll be back in a sec.
Okay.
Oh, Julia, can you, like...
Um...
I'm okay to, like, cover for me.
If you...
It's gonna be...
It's gonna be very temporary, though.
Yeah. Okay.
I'll be back in a minute.
Um...
I guess
my kind of view is
in...
It's kind of...
My disability is the reason why I'm moving later.
But even a little bit.
Um, because everyone has
this mentality on me to
get healed and get better
and, like...
not be disabled, I guess.
And, um,
it kind of stung, because
I always thought, like, why wasn't I...
Why was I...
Why was my disability a factor of
why I...
Was it good?
I guess. I have no idea how to say this.
I mean, I don't...
I don't know.
I know.
I'm back.
Hello.
Glad.
I kind of wanted to join in the conversation with you about Facebook.
About what, say?
About Facebook.
Talking about religion.
A little bit.
Oh, yeah.
And I wanted to say how
my disability was kind of the reason why
I moved away from it a little bit.
Well, a little bit.
And, like, a very strong way where
everyone's family's...
Well, family.
Like, my parents still kind of a little bit more...
A little bit religious.
And, like, grandparents, like,
a little bit more religious than I am.
But, like, to me, it kind of
stung a little bit that
whenever I went to a church
or was around people who are religious,
they always were, like, being able to get healed
and being able to get better
because clearly there's something wrong,
like, you've sinned or
there's something that isn't right.
And I kind of always
thought to myself, like,
why is it my responsibility for me to be healed
if
God intended me to be the way I am
but you're telling me I have to change
and, like, I need to fix it.
Yes,
there are medicines. Like, one can say that
medicine is kind of the answer
to a prayer that people may have
had a thousand, like,
hundreds of years ago.
But nowadays, it's
it's basically your human right
to have medications and, like, be able
to be comfortable.
But it doesn't mean if you completely
change yourself
and be someone you're not.
Yeah.
Does that make sense?
Yeah, definitely.
And I think the one time, like,
I questioned,
like, my RE teacher about this,
she kind of said to me,
well, yeah, you do have to fix.
And I'm like, no, I don't.
Please, don't listen to me like that.
Yeah.
Let's look at this model here.
Can you let me scroll?
No, you can't.
Okay.
Give me one second.
What are we doing now?
Yes, there we go. Okay.
So let's read this article.
Little bit.
And yes, I am aware that I have
suddenly gone silent.
Give me one sec.
Sorry, someone just came to the kitchen
and had been somewhere down in the house.
And someone just came to the kitchen
and I was like, oh no.
Yeah.
No.
Okay, I'm going to, like, go upstairs.
So, actually, do I have time?
I probably don't have time anymore.
This might be the end of my
of your existence.
Of your existence.
That's a bit, uh...
No, of my existence
is what you wanted to say, not existence.
So, it's
existence, not existence.
I'm glad you're not even existing.
Why wouldn't this work?
What all do you have done without me, huh?
I don't know.
There'll be
something in the background somewhere.
Um...
What is this doing?
Please?
I don't know.
Also, I love how this was a 4AM idea.
Uh, it wasn't.
It was, a lot of it was prepared
at 4AM.
Um, but...
Oh, no one's coming.
Sorry, I wanted to meet myself again.
Oh god, that's terrifying.
Yeah, I messed up my camera just a bit.
Um...
Oh, please, can you work?
Right.
Oh, okay.
I'm nearly done.
Now, I can say, this was all prepared.
Very short notice.
So, there we go.
I finally got my camera on.
This does not look very good, but whatever.
Anyway, I'm going to take a look at this
article from
the American Psychological Association.
Um...
So, this is about the three different models
of disability,
the last two are the biggest, I think,
but basically, the models of disability
are about
how people think about disability.
Um...
So, these might be
individual perspectives.
It might be, like, a community,
like the church or something,
has these views
that are very collective.
Um...
So, the model...
I think that's okay to read.
That doesn't look very clear.
Um...
The model
model is
very much associated
with, like, religion.
Um...
Let me resize.
There we go.
Um...
I'll say, I said bye, I'll see you later.
Oh, bye. Thank you for joining
at such short notice. I appreciate it.
Have a good...
If you give me a heads up
next time, I would probably
prefer to talk a bit more, but that's okay.
That's okay. I wasn't expecting
to join, so thank you very much.
Um...
Bye.
Um...
Thank you, Julia, for joining.
That means a lot to me.
Um...
So...
Yeah.
It's about how people view
disability.
The model model is
um...
It's this idea
that
someone has a disability
as a result
of something that may have done.
Uh...
Right. I will try and focus now.
Um...
It can be seen as
a sign of honour sometimes,
a sign of faith,
or a sign of strength, which I didn't
actually know about. Um...
Alternatively,
it can be a result
of, um...
like...
Why can't I see what I'm looking for?
It's a result of bad karma, basically.
Of sin.
What sin did your parents commit
in order for you to be
born disabled?
That's kind of a view that
some people have. Um...
From what I know, that's often like a
quite Roman Catholic view.
Um...
It might also be seen more in
like Eastern religions.
Um...
Well, there's a lot of belief in karma.
And Christians tend to believe that
it's a result of
uh...
a form of punishment
for your parents' deeds.
Um...
So...
Some people
believe that
when the moral model
is pushed onto a disabled person,
they may believe they have to
be a better person to be healed,
or they need to have more faith.
And we very rarely
see that in society.
Um...
There are some
occasions
that have been reported where that does
genuinely happen, but
it can be a lot of...
often it is fake.
Um, not always.
And I try and keep an open mind.
Um, particularly as a Christian,
I know that God does do
incredible things, but that doesn't...
Those incredible things don't always
line up with what we've perceived
as incredible, or
what we would want God to do.
Sometimes, God just does
what is best, and
it just doesn't seem like it from
our perspective. I wasn't intended
to get so religious in this session, but
there we go.
Um, that's my belief, at least.
Um...
So...
Um...
And actually,
I didn't realize I've just read this in the article.
Uh...
Why can I not see it
on the...
Oh, so...
A lot of what I will talk about in
future sessions
is that some movies
will use physical disability
in particular
to show evil.
And actually, that comes from
the moral model,
where we believe that disability
or physical difference
is a sign
of bad, or doing something wrong
or something like that.
Um, and so we see
a lot of disability representation
in the media, but usually
that is negative representation.
Um...
There are so many examples I can give, but I will have
a whole episode for that alone.
Um...
And...
In contrast, some movies
portray a disabled person
as one who goes beyond
usual human levels
to achieve unique goals,
such as a wheelchair user who
plans El Capitan
in Yosemite.
Another example might be...
Uh...
Uh...
I don't know, would you argue
that James is disabled?
Um...
He seems to have
autism. He's like
very not
socially aware.
And...
He fits
the stereotype of
being very intelligent and
what people
would call high-functioning autism.
Um, which is a label that
is less used now.
Um...
Yeah, that's kind of
the moral model.
Um, what's another example
of...
Oh, Toph.
Toph from the Avatar The Last Airbender.
One of my favourite characters,
uh, because
I love her sarcasm.
I love her as a person.
Ha ha ha!
But, she...
So she's blind, but
she uses...
like...
Uh...
Not so now, but like
those vibrations on the ground to
understand what's happening around her.
And, um...
That's kind of...
I think that almost never happens.
Um, her superpowers.
She's a friend
though she has control over
rocks and stuff like that.
Um...
Her superpowers
kind of in a way replace
or, uh, counteract
her disability.
Um...
And that's a bit of an issue because
suddenly she's not disabled, she's actually more
able-bodied
than her
able-bodied friends.
Um...
So, that's another issue that
we can run into in the media.
Uh, I will do a whole
I can ramble
for ages on disability
representation in media.
Um...
I need to remember, but I need to
pet, um...
like, our chat. Is there anyone
saying any of the messages?
If you have any views, please let me know.
Uh, I'd love to hear from other people
and, uh...
Yeah, get people's views and...
Yeah.
So that's a moral model.
I had forgotten about the moral model
because that's not
seen so much.
It definitely is there, particularly
if we're moving away from
kind of religion, which we are
as part of the Western society
when moving towards more scientific views
for Big Bang and stuff like that.
And so we're leaving
religion
and so we're leaving the moral model,
which in a way is good.
Um...
But it is still a model that we see
in the media and stuff like that.
Um...
Medical model
I've already spoken about, but this is like
where we try to get
a person as
close to the norm as possible.
Now, I use norm
in quotation marks. Um...
Because
when we talk about the humans,
there is no normal. Like...
You can't say what is the normal
race of people
because it differs
all over the world.
You can't say what's the normal age
because, again,
it differs. Um...
And, yeah.
There is no normal when we're talking
about the humans. Um...
But when we talk about people,
normal often means able-bodied.
It means, uh...
average.
Uh...
Why you want to be average? I don't know.
But, yeah. So...
It's about trying to get doctors
and medical professionals
to...
Um...
Follow the advice of these experts
and, um...
Everything's very clinical and medical
and very, uh...
Trying to fit it into a box.
We have these diagnoses,
these boxes, and you have to meet
these diagnostic criteria.
Uh...
And, you know, we go on these...
We hunt for the right diagnostic
label. Uh, and if something
isn't quite right, we go to our doctor
and say, hey, I don't think you're right.
I want this diagnosis or whatever it is.
Um...
So...
I like...
Partly like that because
I've got a very scientific and analytical
mind, and I've talked about
different diagnoses and stuff
like that.
But the issue is
we...
Once we find a diagnosis that we think
fits, we try and
use the same
method of fixing
that person.
Um...
As anyone else. And people are just
not on one size, but full.
Um...
It's definitely more complicated to
create bespoke, like, treatment
plans and whatever.
Then just using them one size, but, oh.
But actually, one size...
Uh, but actually bespoke plans
work better because everyone is different
in some way.
Um...
Uh, the medical model
of disability is often depicted
in movies through a plot hole
in which a disabled person
is depressed
and hopeless.
This is sad.
As I was saying earlier, I think
that the media has
a really
major impact on society.
And people who have acquired disabilities
are...
Um...
Have this mindset that disability is
bad and difficult and
life is not worth living.
And in my experience at least, that's just not
true. Um...
But in...
In movies...
But through friendship...
What are we?
But through friendship with an able-bodied person
with the same person learned to embrace life.
Yes, it's this need for
being able-bodied or
even if you can't be able-bodied yourself
having this connection to an able-bodied
person
is what gives happiness. This
is an inference that
uh...
you need to be able-bodied
in order to
have a good life.
Or disability is
the cause of pain and suffering
and well, it can be obviously.
But it's the cause of
being miserable
and so you need to counteract
that with being able-bodied.
Um...
There is a reverse to this idea
of being able-bodied characters to be better people.
Uh...
Yeah...
The issue with that
is that it places
the responsibility
of other people's behavior
on the disabled person.
It's like, right,
you're disabled so you must
tell me
uh... how to be a good person.
Or you must tell me about your disability.
Or you must tell me how
to be a better advocate.
Um... Disabled people don't owe you
anything for starters.
I personally love talking about disability
so I probably wouldn't
in any way, someone who wants to be
more educated on disability, but
that's
my personal preference
not because I am disabled.
Does that make sense?
I hope so.
Um... I'm finally...
I'm running out of breath.
Let me burp a drink.
Um... social model.
Disability is seen
as one aspect of a person's
identity.
This is what I like.
One aspect of a person's
identity.
So, whether or not you're
able-bodied or disabled,
everyone has an identity
and that can be made up of
lots of different attributes.
So, part of my identity,
a big part of my identity, is that
I am disabled. For other people that
be much smaller, but for me
that's basically the main part
of my identity. Another part is that
I'm a Christian. Another part is
that um...
I am a male.
Uh... I am in my twenties
and all of these different things
are
parts of my identity. They all fit together
to make me an unique
person. Um...
So,
yeah, for me personally
I would say disability has
a bigger influence on my life
than race, for example,
or my gender. Um...
I almost never think about
my race.
Instead
it is my disability
that I think about. Um...
I'm in silver time and that's because
society has failed me in some way.
Um... there's no step-free access
I'm like, ah, I'm in a wheelchair.
Um... I can't do that thing
whatever it is. And so
that's why I think it's a big
part of my identity, or part of the
reason why it's a big part of my identity
because it is...
I can't get through a day
without my disability
in some way or another effect on me.
I get out of bed and
I get into my wheelchair, that kind of thing.
So it doesn't have to be a big impact
but obviously able-bodied people
don't
go, well, I need to get into my wheelchair.
You know? Um...
This mask
is doing my head in.
It's trying really hard
to remove the background in real time.
It's struggling, however.
Let me see
if I can give it another CP
thread without it
being upset with me.
Um...
How can I bear?
Because it just flashes at me.
Which bolts.
Nope.
Yeah. My
headrest keeps disappearing
and reappearing.
Not really much I can do about that, unfortunately.
Um...
Yeah.
So that is the...
Oh.
What should I go...
So disability is
rather than a diagnosis
it is more of a
mismatch between
the disabled person and the environment.
Whether that environment is
physical or social.
So, um...
I keep going
to wheelchairs
for obvious reasons. I'm a wheelchair user.
Um, but like a step three
or a building that has steps to get in.
So, because
the
builder doesn't match my access needs
that's where the real disability is.
That's the
effect of disability.
Um...
Or social.
Yeah. Whether you're able to do
social events.
Um...
Yeah.
It is this environment that creates the handicaps
and barriers, not the disability.
From a perspective of a way to address disability
is to change
the environment and society
rather than the disabled person.
Um...
Negative stereotypes and discrimination
and oppression
serve as barriers to environmental
change and full inclusion.
Uh...
Movies that depict disability
from a social model
are more...
More likely to have multiple
disabled characters who form
bonds, learn and grow.
Oh! Just like
an able-bodied character.
I wonder if that's because
I recall
disabled people and able-bodied
people are the exact same.
Hmm!
Um...
Other films show disabled
characters more realistically.
In the context of loving families
who are not burdened by the disability
in a society that discriminates
as activists trying to change laws.
Um...
Yeah, I do like
when disabled
characters in the media
are portrayed
similarly
to able-bodied people.
They have their own wants and needs
in the film. They have their own
personalities.
They are not just there as a plot device.
They are a character,
a 3D character in their own right.
Um...
I love that so much.
Um...
And I think that's one of the reasons
why I love her. Yes.
Her disability
allows for her to be
more honoured. Her superpower
undoes her disability.
But she is still a
character. She is
a person
with her own
social, no,
with her own story arc
and her own views,
her own personality,
her own... She is her own person.
She is not relying
on other people in order to exist.
Um...
Yes, she needs help. But
every other character in
Avatar of the Last Airbender needs help
at some point or another.
Although students have a tendency
to see one model as superior
to the others, there are some potential
benefits and costs to all of these
perspectives. The model
model can bring
shame but also renewed faith.
The medical model
has had tremendous advances
in rehabilitation.
What is paternalistic?
I have no idea what paternalistic means.
Can you tell me?
No, you can't.
Uh...
What does paternalistic mean?
Uh...
I thought it was going to read out to me.
Um... Relating to...
Relating to or
characterised by the restriction
of the freedom and responsibilities
of subordinates or dependents
in men supposed to be in the church.
Wait, I'm trying to understand that.
Uh...
Oh, it disappeared. No!
My dictionary definition
disappeared while I was trying to read it.
Uh...
Paternalistic...
Oh!
Where you're like, um, forcing a...
So...
Hey!
Background filter, are you okay?
Uh, paternalistic
Again, like, when a...
A person is...
Viewed as superior
and is telling you
what to do in order to improve yourself
in a way.
Um, it can be quite condescending, I think.
I hope I got the definition right.
Um...
I'm in the social model...
What's this community?
But...
I don't know where I am...
You can tell that I'm getting tired.
In my defense, I've been going for an hour
and 20 minutes so far.
Um...
My systemic ableism can be overwhelming.
Probably most people have believed
in more than one model.
Which is hard to know, since currently
there is not a well-established
measure of models.
More data are needed
from disabled people
to get their perspective
on the constant benefit of a particular
model of disability.
Hmm...
Yeah, I really like this
article. I've only just found this
and I really like it, because it mentions
uh...
Representation of media.
Something that I'm really passionate about.
Uh...
Really short, really easy to understand.
Thank you very much, Rhoda.
Oh, Ken. Um...
That was a really good article.
Very, very good. Very impressed.
And will give me money.
No, I don't have any money to give, unfortunately.
I'm sorry. Um...
Anyway...
Oh...
My throat hurts. I've been talking a lot.
Um...
But yeah, that's just a bit of
an overview of the three models of disability.
Um...
I will get around
to adding that
to uh...
to our...
our obsidian document.
Um...
But yeah, this is kind of a format
of these sessions.
Um, I now have a green...
That's not what I wanted.
There we go. Um...
That's kind of a format of these sessions.
It is just about, um...
Yeah.
Disability as a whole.
And...
Are we...
Why am I so distractible?
I am so distractible.
I am sorry.
Um...
Where was I?
My brain has gone to sleep.
I'm now brain dead. Not brain dead.
That's not what I meant. Um...
Today was not a good day for me to do this.
Anyway, it's an international day
for people with disabilities.
Um...
Now...
What does that even mean?
Let's look it up.
Uh...
I...
International day people
with disabilities.
They...
Normally have a theme each year.
Uh...
But I've not heard what the theme is this year.
Uh...
They've got to tell us.
Um...
Not that. Not that.
I have no idea what this theme is.
We've not actually said anything.
Which is very helpful.
Uh...
Uh... timeline.
That's not helpful.
Okay. Thank you.
Uh...
Thank you for a not very helpful article
from the United Nations
who put the day in place.
Um...
That's how it's now in my eyes.
That's my phone over my eyes
being my light shade at the moment.
Um...
Yeah. So.
Anyway.
I guess the day is about...
Um...
Of all the different issues in society
that disabled people have to day in place.
Um...
That's how I would summarise it.
I'm actually going to the houses of...
No. Not to the houses of parliament.
I'm going to Westminster.
Uh...
I think it was supposed to be at the houses of parliament
at some point. I mean, it got moved.
But, um, there we go.
I'm going there tomorrow with
Disability Equality Charity
Scope.
You know. Yeah.
The Equality Charity here in the UK.
And that'd be interesting.
I have no idea what to expect.
Um...
Yeah. I'm excited for that.
Um...
Yeah. So my life basically is
me talking about disability.
And I'm going to do that here if you guys are interested.
Um...
To be honest, I probably will do it anyway
even if you're not interested.
Um...
So, yeah.
That's what I'm...
That's what I'm planning to do over the next year or so.
I'm just going to do
maybe not weekly, but maybe every other week
I'll look at a different disability
or a different aspect of disability
or disability representation
in a movie or a TV show
or something like that.
And that's my plan.
I'm also going to be working on
our podcast, Ramp It Up
which is a podcast all about disability
and, uh...
Yeah. The series, as I say, is all about
special interests and
expectations and listening to people
in for it up, which I love so much.
Um...
So I've got editing to do.
Um...
That'll be released in the new year. I'm so excited for that.
Um...
Yeah. It'll be a while till you see me again.
It'll be probably first or second week of January.
I mean, I'll be back looking at
different topics and finding other topics
to look at. Um...
I will also
find a way of making it easier for
any of you guys to access
this obsidian document.
I need to find a way to
properly do that. And the other thing
I will do is I will
find a way of
um...
of making it easier for you
to vote on what I
study, what I look at next.
Um... So my list at the moment is...
Not in there.
Where is it? There.
That's my
really badly formatted list.
Um...
So I need to do
silver palsy.
Let me add a description.
Build.
Description.
Look.
So we're also
going to mention
the chat on my mind.
Which is really good.
I really strongly recommend.
It's really like...
quite emotional. Um...
I'm very relatable as a disabled person.
I would love to talk about that.
Um...
Yeah.
There's loads of different things I want to talk about.
Um...
And...
I hope you'll touch all aspects
at some point or another.
If you have any...
Views or any
topics you want me to cover.
Let me know in the chat. I will keep an eye on it.
And um...
Yeah.
I really look forward to doing a series with you.
Uh...
I think that's me done. I've been going for an hour
and a half nearly.
So my voice is going.
And I have a long day today.
So...
Thank you so much everyone.
